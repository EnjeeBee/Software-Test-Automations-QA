Ensuring Functionality and Security
Ensuring that code, programs, or software are both functional and secure is paramount in software development. To achieve this, I employed several practices throughout the project:

Unit Testing:

Writing comprehensive unit tests using frameworks like JUnit ensures that each component of the software functions as intended. These tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases and invalid inputs, to validate the behavior of the code.

Input Validation:
Implementing robust input validation mechanisms helps prevent unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. By validating user inputs at various points in the code, such as when accepting user input or processing external data, I ensure that only valid and safe inputs are processed.
Security Best Practices: Adhering to security best practices, such as avoiding hardcoded credentials, implementing encryption for sensitive data, and sanitizing inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks, enhances the overall security posture of the software.

Code Reviews:
Conducting code reviews with peers helps identify potential issues, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to coding standards. Collaborative feedback and discussions contribute to building more robust and secure software.

Interpreting User Needs:
Understanding and incorporating user needs are essential aspects of software development. Throughout the project, I employed the following strategies to interpret and address user requirements effectively:

Requirement Analysis:
Thoroughly analyzing and documenting user requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements, helps ensure alignment between the software's capabilities and user expectations. 

Iterative Development: 
Adopting an iterative development approach allows for frequent validation of user needs and requirements. By breaking up my code and testing each new iteration, I can make sure that if issues occur, I won't have to make any changes too deep in the code.

Approach to Designing Software
My approach to designing software encompasses the following principles and practices:

Modular Design: Breaking down the software into modular components promotes reusability, maintainability, and scalability. Each module encapsulates specific functionality, making the codebase more organized and easier to manage.
Object-Oriented Design: Leveraging object-oriented principles, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allows the creation of strong and flexible software architectures. Designing classes and objects that model real-world entities and interactions fosters code clarity and extensibility.
